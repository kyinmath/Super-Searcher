dynamic objects vs dynamic pointers?
	dynamic objects I think, mainly want to be overwritten.
	ASTs actually want dynamic objects, not pointers.
	recursive types want dynamic pointers.
the main issue is that if there are dynamic objects, an object's size can't be inferred from just its type.


dynamic objects are absolutely useless. can't store them except at the end of a type. locally, they can just be optimized dynamic pointers.
