shared memory is divided into two halves. the local admin simply increments a counter, allocating as he goes along. the user follows along with an internal pointer.
	when the admin tries to move from one half to the other, he checks if the user is done with that half. to do this, admin sets the "used" flag on a half whenever allocating from it. then, user clears the "used" flag when user's internal event checking is done with it.
if the admin tries to move from one half to the other and it's still in use, then the user is deadlocked and the admin kills the user.
	

Admin: if only one user left, copy him to all remaining slots.
if no users left, call a country competition.
