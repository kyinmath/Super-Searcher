note that only the country admin needs to get entropy passed in. the individual users can grab entropy from /dev/urandom.

"If it really needs to be fast, shared memory is the way to go. You nearly have zero overhead as the operation system does the usual mapping between virtual and physical addresses and no copy is required for the data. You just have to lookout for concurrency issues.

For actually sending commands like shutdown and query, i would use message queues. I previously used localhost network programming to do that.."

 no user-to-user communication. the purpose here is to prevent cheating.
	later, when they connect to the internet, there will be cheating for sure. but hopefully at that time, there will be more intelligent anti-cheating mechanisms for kings.
	
	
everyone gets one receiver queue. and, they can get other connections as well. we pass in the connection IDs

should IPC memory (vector of int) be streamed or blocks of vectors?
	blocks. because there are different users. and the separation into sentences is meaningful. we might as well use the overhead for good purposes.
	
what happens on allocation failure:
anything to admin -> abort, write to log.
admin to anything -> kill.
user to king -> abort.
king to user -> notify admin, admin will kill.
king to king -> abort.
user to user -> impossible for now.
