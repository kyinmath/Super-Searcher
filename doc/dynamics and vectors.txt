idea: dynamic pointers have fixed targets. so no expansion or deletion. you can replace the pointer with another pointer though.
however, vectors have arbitrary targets. which have fixed types.
unfortunately, in this case we need to work out ownership semantics...
	also, how the hell do we grab the inside of an arbitrary vector?

in practice, the loss of information from having only vectors, instead of arbitrary variadics, is pretty low.
	I never needed it in C++. and you can have a vector of dynamic pointers anyway.
	the plus side is that the type info is very short. so vectors are a very common use case.
