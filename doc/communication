how does a human normally work with interfacing answers? our chess system wants a specific answer format.
	in the real world, you use your hands. for us, that corresponds to words.
	it also means basic communication.
for us, that means vectors of integers are the way to go. corresponding to general speech
	what's more, it's logical that we communicate with the admin using vectors of integers. and it's logical that the users communicate with each other using vectors of integers.
	this does mean that there's no more sexual recombination, but with globals, that isn't significantly possible anyway (unless the addresses actually do happen to match up).
		basically, what it means is that a unique interface, such as a global used for passing, will no longer function as an interface after being sent from user to user.
	
a lot of communication is just immune system self-culling. you want to make sure you can understand your own words, and then you copy yourself.

we should really reuse our king mechanism for self. that is, the way the king judges his constituents, should equally be used for the constituent to judge himself.
	this is really good for king development as well.
	that means you can probably send a message to yourself.

how does the king manage to switch between users? if the king can't, then he'll need to process every user completely before moving on to the next user.
	for the king to switch, he'll need a vector of the entire thing, to remember people. but we only have one copy of goodnes. so we need a switch, to make goodness work on everything equally.
