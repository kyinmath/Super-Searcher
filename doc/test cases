[concatenate [imv 1] [imv 2]] [imv 3]
	still causes extra cast
[concatenate [imv 1] [imv 2]]
	causes a ridiculous amount of GEPs
	in the case of concatenate, stack_degree 2, there's no point in RVO into an existing slot. because you have to load it out from the slot anyway, one at a time.

	why isn't this working? middle is not 0
[concatenate [concatenate [concatenate [integer] [integer]] [integer]] [integer]]
	this works.

//tests moving objects to higher lifetimes. a pointer to in gets stored to p, so the concatenation better stay alive.
