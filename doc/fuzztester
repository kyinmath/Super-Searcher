todo: getting ASTs from other functions
function calls
function units

fuzztester is only for error checking. not for actual operation.
so, when building, we randomly choose load_subobj_refs. then each time we succeed, we store the offset and the AST, by pushing both onto vectors.
	then, we know what can be referenced, by looking at previous ASTs and having smaller-sized offsets. any of those are valid to be referenced.
after we've chosen a spot (which will be either for insertion, deletion, or concatenation), we then construct the new AST. (or lift an old AST).

1. we'll have basic block ASTs.
2. every time we make a new loose AST, we'll want to add it to a basic block AST.
	thus, we first select a basic block AST, and then append to it. then, we get the last element, and then try adding terms.
