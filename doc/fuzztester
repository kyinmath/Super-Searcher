problem 1: we insert an AST, then the fields are chosen. but the subfields can't point to the AST, because it isn't inserted yet.

todo: getting ASTs from other functions
function calls
function units
moving global variables from function to function. in addition, creating these global variables as pointer-to-object. this is super important, because it allows for parameter passing.


basic block appending uses push_back. then the current_AST is set to the new null AST slot.
