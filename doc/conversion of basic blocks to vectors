after: I need to change:

and, load_subobj can't give references anymore as return values. that means chaining must happen downward through fields, instead of across through a basic block.
	but this was a problem before as well. since the AST could be 0.
	actually, we can continue to do this. if the get_element returns 0, we just place a 0 on the stack.
	problem: this only works if the base element actually can be 0. for example, vector base pointers are never 0.
problem: bootstrapping is going to be a lot harder.

current problem: how do I read a vector of something? now I need to get its inside...
	must I really keep it as a vector of something, checking each time I want to dereference?
	or, might I be able to force its type? if I know its exact type, I can try to store it into an existing vector with known type. but if I don't know its exact type (for example, if its internal is a pointer), then I'm in the usual trouble.
so we have, in the future, try_store().


second problem: load_subobj should return a reference. but for vectors, that isn't always possible.


note: basic block ASTs shouldn't be treated like vectors of ASTs? or maybe they should.
	having them treated like vectors breaks the transparency that the ASTs are embedded.
basic block AST: you can load_subobj_ref transparently.
but in general, you should load the vector from the interior. because otherwise, there's no way to push_back() the contents of the vector, since you don't know that the AST's tag will be ASTn("basicblock").
