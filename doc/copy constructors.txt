suppose we do have ownership objects. how do we look inside them? we can't load them; that will make a gigantic copy.
thus, we note that copy constructors are basically always bad. nothing should ever have a copy constructor, because that makes it impossible to read it.
	for example, C++ has references, which are basically pointers. whenever manipulating or reading an object, you always use the pointer *this.
