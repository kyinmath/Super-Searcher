DON'T BOTHER. our Type wants to point to more Types. but we can't get "const Type*", because we don't know that the target will be const. and we can't get "Type*", because then we can't point to const types.

What's more, even though reinterpret_cast doesn't work for consexpr, const_cast does! Hooray!
