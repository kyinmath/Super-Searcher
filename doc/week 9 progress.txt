Implemented goto and labels, dynamic object concatenation, type conversion from dynamic object to AST static object
Type conversion failure relies on "exception handling" (gotos) to escape the failure case.
ASTs are slowly becoming fully dynamic objects with variadic fields - now, they can only be pointed to, and they can possess fully general components, not just pointers to other ASTs

You can create and compile ASTs inside the language now. Try:
./toy console
[label]a [compile [convert_to_AST [integer 1] [dynamic] [goto a]]]


Or:
[label]a [hello] [goto a]
