ASTs would silently stop being written to console, even though everything was compiling correctly. But the new fuzzer behavior extracted this segfault.
Unique type creator. Recursively generates types to handle pointer issues. File is in src/unique_type_creator.h.
Dynamic pointers can now be created.

My new concern is that my concatenate() function probably won't work too well with dynamic memory, because it will have to copy to make memory contiguous. I'm thinking about introducing twines for dynamic pointers.
Next week will be adding ASTs to read dynamic pointers. The challenge is mainly that I'll need to add fuzzing to test these dynamic pointers, which will require random type generation, which I don't have yet.
Also, sometimes llvm emits some error messages, and I want this to abort the program, but it doesn't.
