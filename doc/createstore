how does dynamic_conc produce the AST fields we want, if we can't overwrite a dynamic object's type?
	normally, we just want a loop that'll concatenate until we're done. which requires changng the dynamic object's type.
	this means that overwriting the type of a dynamic object is a crucial ability.
	that means that we ought to keep track of when we can and can't overwrite the dynamic object's type, automatically. (basically, if any references to the insude exist)

problem: what happens to pointer lifetimes when we use createstore? the old one will have to change...


createstore(pointer, value)
	first value can be either cheap or full pointer.
