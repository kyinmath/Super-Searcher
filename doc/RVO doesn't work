our if handling is not right.
in the branch, you can get a pointer to one of the possible types.
	but it might RVO into a different type. you're left holding a pointer that's not valid.

so no stack_degree == 1.




[concatenate [imv 1] [imv 2]]
	causes a ridiculous amount of GEPs when RVOing. in contrast, if we don't RVO, it's a simple "ret [2 x i64] [i64 1, i64 2]"
	in the case of concatenate, stack_degree 2, there's no point in RVO into an existing slot. because you have to load it out from the slot anyway, one at a time.
