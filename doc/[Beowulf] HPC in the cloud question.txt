Mike,

What are the characteristics of your cluster workloads? Are they tightly 
coupled jobs, or are they embarassingly parallel or serial jobs? I find 
it hard to believe that a virtualized, ethernet shared network 
infrastructure can compete with FDR IB for performance on tightly 
coupled jobs. AWS HPC representatives came to my school to give a 
presentation on their offerings, and even they admitted as much.

If your workloads are communication intensive, I'd think harder about 
using the cloud, or find a cloud provider that provides IB for HPC 
(there are a few that do, but I can't remember their names).  If your 
workloads are loosely-coupled jobs or many serial jobs, AWS or similar 
might be fine. AWS does not provide IB, and in fact shares very little 
information about their network architecture, making it had to compare 
to other offerings without actually running benchmarks.

If your users primarily interact with the cluster through command-line 
logins, using the cloud shouldn't be noticeably different the 
hostname(s) they have to SSH to will be different, and moving data in an 
out might be different, but compiling and submitting jobs should be the 
same if you make the same tools available in the cloud that you have on 
your local clusters.
