Added lots of documentation, both in "doc/" and in comments in the code.
Wrote a line wrapper. Please don't try to run it, because it only runs on Windows, requires the _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNING preprocessor macro if compiled for Visual Studio, and has my local folder paths built in. (but if these three issues are taken care of, it will work). It's aware of strings, macros, and comments, and preserves tabs.
100-column files are now in "wrapped/".
Cleaned up comments so that the "src/" files don't wrap on my screen.

Implemented type system
Implemented pointers
Implemented variables
New command line arguments - see readme.md

Right now, the fuzzer produces errors after a while. This is because the function signature states that the return type is an "integer", and sometimes we return a "pointer". This will be fixed in the final AST design which should involve entire functions. Since I want my fuzzer to produce no errors, I'll probably work on functions next.
