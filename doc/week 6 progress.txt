Implemented console output in inputtable format.
Added braces to the input format, so that all well-formed ASTs can now be input.
Cleaned up console input significantly; it now uses a get_token() command.
Cleaned up several segfaults.
Added "quiet" mode to facilitate profiling. "Quiet mode" still has "Hello world!" outputs, but I'll leave it as is for now.
I profiled it. Turns out llvm JIT is slow. The picture is in "doc/profiling information.png". The relevant count is in the "Self" column, and the thing to note is that almost all the heaviest functions are llvm functions.
	AST generation takes ~0.2% of the time. So LLVM is the real bottleneck.

Makefile now automatically removes the core file, since Ubuntu has a bug where core dumps don't overwrite previous core dumps. This may not be a good thing for everyone.

todo: check if unreachable is really working by placing one in main
todo: my fuzztester generates long tree branches quickly, which leads to a lot of duplicates. this means that concatenate() never really gets a chance to work.
