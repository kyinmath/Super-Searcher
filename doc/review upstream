how do set up a review system for upstream projects like the kernel and llvm?
there should be incentives for catching bugs.
	then, they should be able to judge themselves. declaring "I have N bugs". then compare.
disputes will go to me. I set a penalty, which should be high, so that people will submit accurate reports. except...
	I will make mistakes. we don't want people to be able to force each other into agreeing with poor judgments (ultimatum game)
	so it should be high, but not obscene.

what about ambiguous bugs? one will have it, and one won't.
	then, maybe we let them agree to compromise? so in what way is this better than having a gradient of bug severity? and won't it create conflicts over whether to compromise or not?




if there's only one copy of the source code, it's vulnerable to someone sneaking in changes after rooting the computer (like Linux kernel).
	even if there are many copies, they should be compared to each other.
