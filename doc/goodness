approximate goodness: Goodness absolutely must be divided into a few functions, so that judgment can work properly.
	then, something must choose the appropriate goodness function.
	the chooser is a single function, with a big tree and maybe some persistent memory, and maybe some gotos.
	it returns the function pointer.

is it ok that the chooser is only a single level? because then judgment has a hard time working with the chooser.
	so the answer is no. instead, approximate goodness is a huge mess of functions. each function returns a different function. judgment stores each function in turn, and runs it.
