Added lots of documentation, both in "doc/" and in comments in the code.
Wrote a line wrapper. Please don't try to run it, because it only runs on Windows, requires the _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNING preprocessor macro if compiled for Visual Studio, and has my local folder paths built in.
100-column files are now in "wrapped/".
Cleaned up comments so that the "src/" files don't wrap on my screen.
