"Twenty-five of our reported GCC bugs have been classified as P1, the maximum, release-blocking priority for GCC defects. Our results suggest that fixed test suites—the main way that compilers are tested—are an inadequate mechanism for quality control."




iwyu doesn't work: I added <thread> and no change.
sudo apt-get install iwyu
make -k CXX=/usr/bin/iwyu


use the sanitizers!
	harmless, it's a library bug: http://lists.cs.uiuc.edu/pipermail/cfe-dev/2013-January/027401.html
		runtime error: load of value 4294967221, which is not a valid value for type 'std::_Ios_Fmtflags'

make fast
valgrind --tool=callgrind ./toy benchmark longrun 1000
kcachegrind

If you don't want to install kcachegrind, instead replace 63376 with the appropriate number, and run
callgrind_annotate callgrind.out.63376 >profile
The results will be in the file "profile".
Note: the "prof" tool doesn't work on VMware, so that's why I use callgrind.
