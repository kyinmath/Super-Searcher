	it doesn't have the huge memory leaks that otherwise exist. maybe just the small normal one.
	seems none at all. 21.1 MB baseline, changed to 21.3 MB baseline after first run finished, then...for a long time, no change. so no leaks.
	"label" causes memleaks.



"Twenty-five of our reported GCC bugs have been classified as P1, the maximum, release-blocking priority for GCC defects. Our results suggest that fixed test suites—the main way that compilers are tested—are an inadequate mechanism for quality control."
