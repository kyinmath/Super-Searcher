()reverse_concatenate for constructing out of order
()sizeof Type, which counts the memory it occupies. maybe we should also have a version that counts other overhead.
	this is what's used to find the size of a normal dynamic object
()return, which does an early return
()get system values(int), returns int:
	= # of AST tags
	= finiteness
	= random integer
	= number of users
	= working size memory
	= system clock
	= my user ID inside the country (unique)
	= country ID (unique)
	= country size, number of countries, who is the controller in your country, who are the other users in the country
	= suicide. however, requires some kind of confirmation. otherwise, it'll be super bad for the user to luck into this.
()get system values(int, int)
	= # of AST fields for tag N
	= AES encode
	= AES decode
	we never return type tags, because user doesn't need to know them.
()action command(int, int)
	= print to console
()action command(int)
	= GC schedule

()get pointer to function for event driven framework. a specific function is run on an event. possible events:
	user start (modify directed judgment)
	country start (modify the random judgment)
	other user crash (maybe GC OOM, system OOM, or something)
	generic running
	message
	vote called, for killing someone (is there a threshold to start voting? can anyone call a vote? maybe you need N votes)

are votes anonymous, or completely private, or public? 
	will public votes lead to voting blocs?
	public votes will likely lead to tit for tat. but public votes also lead to feedback on voting quality (meaningful feedback? in a way, yes, if there is honest feedback)
	maybe voting blocs can be stamped out.


__dynamic object
()append-in-place only. fails if no space.
()Truncate(X). going down to X.
	problem: this isn't possible. so how will something like a stack be done? user will have to keep track of a separate "size" object, whereas the size of the dynamic object will simply be for memory management...
()change_reserved_memory
()get_reserved_memory_size()
()get Nth element.


How is country competition going to work?
	we need a voting system.
	this requires single point of contact. for example, controlling a machine, or competing against other countries.
	but King has problems with single-point-of-failure. and isolation of knowledge - he's the only one who knows how to do things.
		unfortunately, having only a single king around means he has no competition to improve himself. if the other subusers in a country want a better king, it's hard, because nobody else has experience with kingship.
%Delete user (can be overwritten later). You can't delete yourself; somebody has to be the king.
%delegate kingship
%revolution, if you are not king.
%vote for king.
communicate with me (encrypted)
how much RAM does the system support

You get your own filesystem that you can read and write to (but not execute). You have a special NFS folder that people can read from. You can move stuff from virtual drive <--> filesystem.
	NFS folder is vulnerable to denial of service.
	A lot of the file access is filesystem-to-your-own-filesystem transfer, then reading directly from your own filesystem. But you can still bypass the disk and load directly to RAM.

Your allowed computer is on a different physical machine for isolation, security, and increased computing power at the cost of latency.
Virtual machines are not to be trusted, because they are insufficiently tested.

user to user communication: raw sockets. (no UDP)
boost asio.
encryption, how? this is an admin issue, because the user should be able to identify itself authoritatively.
	when a new user is placed online, I manually give the user its private key.
	then, I use my own encryption key to tell all the users the public key.
How does the user communicate with me? This is also crucial. My computer must respond in a fixed, expected way.
Revolution: threshold, 1 to N-1, that when reached, kills the king. Should be invisible to the king.

no scope(). because label allows the user to do goto to a lot of places.
no need to load type from dynamic, because you can do nothing with types (except compare them, but you can still do nothing). the interesting AST is instead the dynamic_subobj, which already returns the type.
	well, except that you can load the return type of a function. this is useful. so maybe loading types from dynamic is useful as well.

machine input (mouse and keyboard) and output (screen)
	size of each screen

inputs: sight, sound, access to computer, memory usage, cpu usage, real time, country actions (kings, war results, person transfer, country changes (size or number), new user creation)
	later: temperature, touch
outputs: vocal (64 channels for now), mouse, access to virtual machine
