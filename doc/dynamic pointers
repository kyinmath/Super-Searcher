dynamic_conc is pretty inefficient because it makes lots of copies. but for now, we don't care too much

let's say you're browsing through the Big Tree of Stuff, and you get a dynamic pointer. it contains some structure and a function.
	how does the dynamic pointer assert into a static type?


dynamic objects must be able to handle nullptr.
	to support recursive objects
	to support variable numbers of arguments, such as for convert_to_AST.

null types are useful for function return types. and for scope().
