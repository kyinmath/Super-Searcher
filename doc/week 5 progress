Wrote a lot of docs - you can find them in types.h and cs11.cpp
Decision made to flatten the llvm types into just integers. So llvm won't see any pointers.
	The reasoning is that it was easy. There are bigger issues in the way I'm smashing integers together using "concatenate". I should go for the easy fruit first.
	The alternative, of keeping a complete llvm type system, is very hard. With later things like recursive types, it's going to be a pain.
No more segfaulting.
