if we have a dynamic pointer, how do we extract information from it?



suppose we have a compiled function. it points to an AST. when the function dies, should we really unimmut the old ASTs? is that at all useful?
	yeah, it's vital. we don't want to create new copies all the time. and we use compilation as error_checking, so we compile a function many times as we create it.


perhaps: we want createstore to be a simply mem copy.
then, dynamic pointers, AST pointers, type pointers: can be double indirection.
	this lets us overwrite multiple-field objects atomically, by creating a whole new copy.
but any old references are going to be left behind forever. for example, if you get a dynamic pointer to the various fields.
	for both ASTs and Types, we can require passthrough using their concatenate() operations.
for dynamic pointers, 128bit atomic is nice, but there are worries about alignment.
