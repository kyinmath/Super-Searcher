cryptocpp:

AutoSeededRandomPool rnd;
// Generate a random key
SecByteBlock key(0x00, AES::DEFAULT_KEYLENGTH);
rnd.GenerateBlock( key, key.size() );
// Generate a random IV
byte iv[AES::BLOCKSIZE];
rnd.GenerateBlock(iv, AES::BLOCKSIZE);




to get 256 bits, note that we have 26 random letters = 5 bits per character.
this means 50 characters.
	realistically, we need 100 characters, since I have known patterns in typing.

but the machine doesn't really need that security.
instead, the parent machine can take in dev/urandom every once in a while to reseed things.

question: OOM is going to be a problem. how do I force the OOM killer to kill the workers, instead of the admin?
