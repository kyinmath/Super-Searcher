I figured out why llvm was segfaulting. I was using llvm_unreachable() to assert(), but it silently changed behavior in 2011: https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=8973
My error checks were being silently bypassed. I replaced llvm_unreachable() with a new error() function. Hopefully, there will be no more mysterious segfaults on execution.
Hacked-up AST to generate random ASTs, "temp_generate_AST"
Hacked-up AST to compile ASTs, "compile". Segfaults at the moment.

LLVM's JIT bindings are once again going through a complete overhaul. Since this will totally change memory management, I'm going to give up on my memory manager and let my functions leak for now.

Static/dynamic checking
valgrind --tool=memcheck ./toy
	found leaks but no memory errors
scan-build --use-analyzer /usr/lib/llvm-3.6/bin/clang make
	found nothing
