Overhauled the constexpr enum to support rare modifiers, so types.h is cleaner. The enums represent more info and don't duplicate information.
Compile system automatically checks the type information, so there's less code needed for individual cases, and less potential for careless bugs.
	Fixed a lot of bugs caused by my automatic type checking. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Implemented console input. Run "./toy console", then write the code when prompted. Example: [integer 5]int_load [if [integer 1] [copy int_load] [integer 6]]

Each [] represents an AST. The structure is [tag field1 field2 field3 field4]name. So the first AST loads the number 5, with the variable name "int_load". The second AST is an if statement whose condition value is 1, so it evaluates to true and runs the "copy int_load" function. Then, the result of this copy is returned.
